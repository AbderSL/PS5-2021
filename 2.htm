PlayStation 5. A name that will not surprise anyone, since it will be the fifth
home console of the manufacturer.&nbsp;Twenty-six years after the first
PlayStation, the PS5 will have to confirm the good health of the Japanese giant
who dominated the eighth generation of consoles.&nbsp;Sony has sold more than
100 million PlayStation systems worldwide, while rival Microsoft is struggling
to reach the 50 million Xbox mark</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif";color:#232323'>In June 2020, the consoler however
confirmed a notable element: his PS5 will not be the only device available to
players.&nbsp;They will have the choice between a standard model, with a disc
player (Blu-ray Ultra HD), and a console that will not.&nbsp;This Digital
Edition, slightly thinner and probably a little cheaper, will therefore require
to download all the games on its storage space</span></p>
