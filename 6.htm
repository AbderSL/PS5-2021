color:#232323;text-decoration:none'>Sony has indeed created the surprise by
unveiling it</a><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#232323'>&nbsp;&nbsp;in April 2020,
since it completely breaks with the DualShock series</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif";color:#232323'>It is therefore not a DualShock 5 that must
be waited for, but a DualSense, in reference in particular to the new haptic
feedback technology designed to offer a&nbsp;</span><i><span style='font-size:
11.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#232323'>&quot;rich
panel of sensations, like a slight feeling of heaviness while driving a vehicle
in the mud ”</span></i><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#232323'>&nbsp;.&nbsp;It will replace
the “vibration” technology used in the DualShock series, and will be
accompanied by&nbsp;</span><i><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#232323'>“adaptive”</span></i><span

color:#232323'>&nbsp;triggers&nbsp;in the L2 and R2 keys.&nbsp;Here again, it
is above all a question of sensations, Sony affirming that the players will be
able to&nbsp;</span><i><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;
font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";color:#232323'>“really feel the tension in
[their] actions, like [when] bending a bow to shoot an arrow”</span></i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";
color:#232323'>.&nbsp;The controller can also offer different sensations
depending on whether you use a machine gun or a shotgun, and thus reinforce the
feeling of immersion</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:
"Arial","sans-serif";color:#232323'>Also provided with a new CREATE button that
Sony presents as an evolution of the SHARE button it replaces, the DualSense
also intends to promote sharing between players.&nbsp;A set of microphones is
also integrated there to converse online.&nbsp;Note of course to finish that
the new controller from Sony also inaugurates a new design.&nbsp;The curves are
more generous and there is a rather unusual marriage of colors with the
consoler Nippon, who also claims to have tested this DualSense&nbsp;</span><i><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:115%;font-family:"Arial","sans-serif";

also be at the rendezvous thanks to a reasonable weight, given the good
autonomy announced at least, since it was not specified.</span></p>
